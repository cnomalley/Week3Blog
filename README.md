### Art Piece 1
![Hello World Project](images/Image_1.png?raw=true "Hello World")

I struggled with this Hello World project, and I was frustrated that I was unable to bring to life the vision and ideas I had in my head. I really wanted to incorporate photos and movement into the piece, but unfortunately every time I tried to code (researching other people’s code, too), it didn’t work. I’m hoping that with more learning and more practice, I’ll be able to achieve my initial intentions better.
	
One thing I was excited about was the concept behind my Hello World piece. While doing research on code, on top of the research on artists for one of the blog posts, I came to discover a fascination with the notion of infinity in a work. The idea behind my final work is visualizing thoughts. I specifically want to visualize the infinite, overwhelming feeling thoughts can sometimes take - something author John Green calls “thought spirals”. I’m considering coming back to this idea for my final project.
